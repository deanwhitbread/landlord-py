# Landlord Card Game
## Introduction
### What is Landlord?
Landlord is a Chinese card game (called ‘Dou dizhu’) consisting of three players, where two players collaborate in a team (called ‘peasants’) to beat the landlord. The game uses the entire deck of cards, including the two joker cards, and each player receives 17 cards before bidding to become the landlord. When bidding concludes, the highest bidder becomes the landlord and the highest bid reflects the round stake. Additionally, the landlord receives the remaining three wildcards which are revealed to all the players before the round commences. 

The objective of the game is to become the first player to have no cards. If the landlord player has no cards first, they win the round and each peasant player pays the landlord the round stake. Similarly, if one of the peasant players is first to have no cards, they win the round and the landlord pays each peasant player the round stake.

A more in-depth description of the card game, including the rules, possible card hands, and card rankings, can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu).
